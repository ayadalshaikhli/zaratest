                STORY Oracle is a newly established direct-to-consumer fashion
                accessories brand, which means "undefined fashion". We hope to
                create the "unique" one for everyone. We love every passion and
                interest on Earth because it is a reference to the UNIQUENESS of
                everything.

                Our mission is to design modern, timeless and durable products
                that you can also afford. They can be mixed and matched and
                there is never a shortage of jewellery to covet, collect and
                stack. You'll have to trust us when we say that one piece will
                never be enough! QUALITY When buying jewelry, it’s imperative to
                purchase high quality pieces that will last. Our business is
                proud to use recycled gold, 100% 925 sterling silver, pearls,
                sparkling diamonds and gemstones. All of our items are always
                water and tarnish resistant and are intentionally curated to
                last a long time. Experience our finely crafted jewellery for a
                touch of timeless, laid-back everyday luxury. SUSTAINABILITY We
                are on the road to sustainability. To avoid over production, we
                always release new products in small batches and if you guys
                love it and want more…we’ll make more. When it comes to
                releasing new products, we don’t adhere to typical seasonal
                launches as we believe that any we design and create will stand
                the test of time, not the season. Our production and metals
                respect the planet we live in and are ethically sourced. Not
                only that, we also care about sustainability, we use less
                plastic, which is why each piece is packaged in reusable and
                biodegradable materials. HOPE We expect you'll find a high value
                collection here for every profession, hobby, sport, passion or
                anything you might think of. We want you to always be who you
                are and we can be with you as you explore your own path in life.
